Examination System Project Description
This repository contains a console-based application called Examination System, developed using C#. The project demonstrates key Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts through a practical implementation.

The system supports different exam types such as Final Exams and Practical Exams, with various question formats like True/False and Multiple Choice Questions (MCQs).

It showcases essential OOP principles including inheritance, interfaces, and polymorphism. The application also uses features like constructor chaining, method overriding, and interface implementation to enhance flexibility and maintainability.

The main goal of this project is to create a modular and scalable examination system while practicing advanced C# concepts. The system efficiently manages subjects, questions, and answers while providing interactive functionality.
